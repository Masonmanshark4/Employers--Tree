## Description

This is a command line application that allows a user to manage information on employees within a company. The application connects to a database housed in MySQL that contains three tables with information on departments, roles, and employees within the company. This Content Management System allows a user to add, view, and modify information about employees of a company.

## Introduction

The database was initialized in MySQL Workbench after the schema files were set up. Data for employees was then seeded into the database after initialization. Upon running the program via the command line interface, a user can select to view all departments, roles, employees, add a department, role, employee, update an employee's current role, manager, remove an employee, department, role, and get the total salary for a specific department. After executing any of the add, update, or remove functions, the database is updated automatically.
